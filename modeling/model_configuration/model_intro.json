["The following clauses will list and detail the classes and enumerations from each of the 3T-SBOM-EMS model packages.", 
 "The 3T-SBOM-EMS is defining model elements that are designed as place-holders for specific pieces of information. The model itself does not require anyone to share or expose every possible piece of information, but it defines how to share and expose them when there is an agreement or requirement for them to be shared and exposed.", 
 "The 3T-SBOM-EMS model is also designed to support document-formatting as well as graph-formatting. The former is achieved by the serialization of instances of the classes from the model, according to serialization guidelines. The latter is achieved by a node-oriented modeling of concepts, with possible relationships between these.", 
 "As shown in figure 1, the Tool-to-Tool Software Bill of Materials Exchange Metamodel Standard metamodel consists of multiple packages: the Artifact Package, the Relationship Package, the Content Package, the Annotation Package, the Licensing Package, the Build Package, and the Assurance Package."]
